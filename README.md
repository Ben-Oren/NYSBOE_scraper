# NYSBOE_scraper
Scraper for the political donation information maintained by the NYS board of elections at https://publicreporting.elections.ny.gov/CandidateCommitteeDisclosure/CandidateCommitteeDisclosure

Why does this site need to be scraped?  It was recently broken in an update.  While the site is still usable, the accessibility of the data across time, contributors and offices has been severely curtailed.  

That this happened while Andrew Cuomo is imbroiled in scandal, and space has opened up in holding New York politicians accountable, might not be an accident.  

In any event, one of the foundational necessary mechanisms in our current democracy is to see how much who is donating to whom, and when they're donating it.  This information needs to be functionally accessible.
